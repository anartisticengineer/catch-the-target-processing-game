<h1>Catch The Target (WIP)</h1>
<h2>(Sorry I can't think of a more creative name)</h2>

<strong>NOTE: this game includes the ControlP5 library~ensure you have it installed in Processing before starting.</strong>

<p>A small game created using Processing. The objective (and controls) are simple:</p>

<p>Catch the target as it appears on the screen. Hitting the target will place the next one on a new random spot.</p>

<p>The only controls needed are the arrow keys. Use them to change direction, and head towards the target. When you hit (most of) the targets, your player will incrementally speed up a little! But you'll see what I mean by "most of" the targets.</p>

<p>You'll encounter 4 different types:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A regular target: nothing really too special here.</li>
    <li>A bonus target: Hitting this target is kinda like the regular one, but it gives you a bit of extra points (well 5 times that of the original target ;)) These are the <strong>GOLD</strong> targets.</li>
    <li>A freeze target: Hitting the one will reduce your speed a little bit. This could especially be helpful if your speed gets to be a bit too outrageous and rage inducing (which it probably will). These are the <strong>BLUE</strong> targets.</li>
    <li>A BAD target: <strong>DON'T HIT THIS ONE!</strong> This one results in an automatic game over, and a loss of all your hard work. But don't worry, it'll go away (eventually). This is the <strong>PURPLE</strong> target.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sending your player out of bounds or accidentally hitting the bad purple target means GAME OVER</p>
